Class/Data/TIN version 0.01
===========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Class::Data::TIN implements Translucent Inheritable Nonpolluting Class Data.

The thing I don't like with Class::Data::Inheritable or the implementations suggested in perltootc is that you end up with lots of accessor routines in your namespace.

Class::Data::TIN works around this "problem" by storing the Class Data in its own namespace (mirroring the namespace and @ISA hierarchies of the modules using it) and supplying the using packages with (at this time) three meta-accessors called C<get_classdata> (or just C<get>), C<set_classdata> (C<set>) and C<append_classdata> (C<append>). It achieves this with some black magic (namespace munging & evaling).

Take a look at test.pl for some examples.
